The task is developing a tic-tac-toe (TTT) with some unique additional rules to the game. The normal TTT will have a 3x3 board, but this version will upgrade the board to 3x4, this can support the game to have some unique rules added in. For example, for the row, the player needs to get 4 in a row to win but for the column and diagonally will same as the normal TTT. Therefore, the winning combos from 8 increase to 11, and this will support the player to have more tactics. Secondly, the normal TTT have an X or O symbol, but for this version instead of using X and O, the game will use R and W. Lastly, the board will have some changes to make the board look more special and unique for example, in the middle row of the board, I have used the letter “T” to separate each of the inputs, so when the user inputs the symbol into the board then the middle will display “R T W” and this will be my name (Robert Tang Wu).
